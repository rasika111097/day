                    <p>Actaea pachypoda, commonly called white baneberry or “doll’s eyes,” is a shade‑loving perennial
                        native to eastern North America. All parts of the plant are poisonous—especially the bright
                        white berries and the roots—causing symptoms like burning mouth, stomach cramps, dizziness, and
                        even cardiac effects if ingested in larger amounts. The berries are harmless to birds, which eat
                        them and spread the seeds, while short‑tongued bees collect pollen from the spring flower
                        clusters. It’s a great ornamental for woodland gardens, but keep it away from children and pets
                        because of its high toxicity .
                        The plant in the image is most commonly known as white baneberry or doll's-eyes (Actaea
                        pachypoda). It is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America, primarily found in
                        rich, moist woodlands.</p>
